Preprocessing, exploration and analysis of the data collected by the NASA-build satellite Kepler Space Observatory, launched in 2009. The dataset is a cumulative record of all observed "objects of interest".

**KeplerClassification_modeling.Rmd** contains several classification models performed on the data, with the aim of detect exoplantes among all the celestial bodies examined.
